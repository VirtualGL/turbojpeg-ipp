Title TurboJPEG
Version 1.03
Description TurboJPEG provides a minimalistic interface for compressing true color
bitmaps into JPEG images in memory.  It abstracts a variety of vendor-specific JPEG codecs into a common API that is used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC as the default method of image compression.

The Mac version of TurboJPEG is built using the Intel¨ Integrated
Performance Primitives, a set of highly-optimized multimedia libraries for
x86 processors.  The use of Intel¨ IPP allows TurboJPEG to compress
1-megapixel images at 20-30 frames/sec or greater.

See the ReadMe file included with this package for information about using TurboJPEG with your own applications.
